                    <br><p>Social media, web-based digital platforms enabling people to get access to new information, share ideas and interact with each other, has become an indispensable part of our daily activities. Undoubtedly, they have revolutionised the way people live and perceive their everyday life. In this context, social media have facilitated communication, rendering it much easier and faster among users. They allow the exchange of user-generated content like texts, data, pictures and videos to take place and to come in different forms such as blogs, business forums, podcasts, microblogs, photo sharing, product/service review, weblogs etc.</p>
                        
                    <p>Culture is shaped by, hence it shapes the use of social media to connect to its audience, current and potential. <br> To foster relations with existing and/or potential visitors and engage them in their collections, exhibitions, and events GLAMs have come to realize the value of including these technological trends as parts of their communication and outreach activities. </p><p>Social media can assist GLAMs in:
                    <ul><li>expanding their audience</li>
<li>spreading messages</li>
<li>displaying their collection</li></ul>

<p>So, a new opportunity of engaging people with culture comes out: </p><br>

                    <br><p>When it comes to <b>youth engagement</b>, we specifically refer to the active participation of youth in culture. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tik Tok and YouTube, are some of the digital tools young people engage with on a daily basis. Furthermore, this interaction takes place through new images, special content and sophisticated graphics that exhilarate their interest! </p>
                    <p>Therefore, a very significant element to take into consideration when aspiring to achieve youth engagement through social media, is the design and the visual interpretation of cultural artefacts. According to Stuedahl (2018), “visual interpretation, social semiotic, semantic and spatial practices are inherent in the everyday social media use”. Specifically, Stuedahl research focuses on Instagram and how users can engage with cultural heritage through this digital platform.</p>

                    <h1 class="mt-4">1.3. Social media as means of disseminating educational material</h1>
                    <br><p>Social media function as a catalyst for creating opportunities in the field of education, as they encourage the spreading of digital media use and learning initiatives. Considering that new technologies are influencing the way young people learn, play, socialize and participate in civic life, it has become crucial to educate ourselves about social media; thus, acquire knowledge of innovations launched on the internet that can help us communicate with younger audiences.</p>

<p>In particular, several afterschool programs, libraries and museums have already developed digital media practices to support extracurricular learning. There is still though a long way for institutions to go through in order to reach their true potential in forging participatory culture and youth engagement. According to the MacArthur report (2006), which focuses on how youth-serving organisations in the USA have adopted technological practices into their educational programs, institutions should address issues like the unequal access of youth to skills development lessons, the importance of educating youth to recognize the way social media can shape our views and values and the evolution of traditional forms of education and training needed to prepare young people to integrate into new public roles.</p> 
                <p>Considering that social media are tools to create personalized learning and engagement pathways inside GLAMs and to promote connectivity, we focus now on strategies and opportunities arising from their use. Specifically, we will outline the strategies and approaches for deepening audience engagement with digitally-mediated cultural heritage following the study of Charatzopoulou et al, (2016).</p>

<p>This report examined several strategies by means of case studies, interviews, a survey of the literature and GLAMs’ institutional documentation. Essentially, the research of Charatzopoulou K., Hagedorn-Saupe M., Prehn A., (2016), focuses on the need of cultural institutions to develop a digital strategy that will include a series of actions from the digitization of collections, the use of social media-oriented to enhance audience engagement, the introduction of digital products and services (online shops, e-tickets etc.), to the training of the staff of the institutions so that they can adopt digital practices as part of their everyday action plans. According to the strategies outlined in the Charatzopoulou K., Hagedorn-Saupe M., Prehn A., (2016) report, GLAMs should:</p>
                    <ul>

<li>embrace a holistic vision, aligned to the institutional mission</li>
<li>assess whether an organisation is digitally ready</li>
<li>develop a non- digital-centric- ness approach</li>
<li>embrace change, renewal and openness as part of the strategic vision</li>
<li>infuse a culture of openness in the organisation</li>
<li>bring attention to efficient work in multidisciplinary teams</li>
<li>capitalise on existing assets and resources and prior digital programmes</li>
<li>use effective, flexible and user-centred design methodologies.</li>
                        </ul>
Social media and social networks serve various entrepreneurs and institutions such as museums, libraries, galleries and archives in their effort to enhance their influence and grow their audience through these technologies.

<p>Following the strategies reported in the research above, we will create a set of actions for GLAMs to learn how to engage with their audience through social media channels to ensure knowledge transferability and better meet the needs of their target groups.</p>

                     <br><p>In April 2020, when almost all museums around the world were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) ran a survey on cultural institutions in order to better respond to the emergency and the difficulties arisen in its network <a href="https://icom.museum/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Report-Museums-and-COVID-19.pdf">(ICOM, 2020)</a>. According to this survey, 94,7% of the museums that participated in it were closed.  

<p>During the lockdown, many museums reconsidered and revalued their digital activities. Although it was shown that half of the museums that were part of the survey had already a presence on social media, digital communication activities have been augmented in at least 15% of the cases. Cultural institutions used their social networks in order to engage with the audience, by using mainstream digital tools (email, website) and social networking tools. Therefore, social media activities saw an outstanding increase in numbers in more than half of the museums surveyed.</p>

                     <p>Under the pandemic circumstances, UNESCO also launched a <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373530/PDF/373530eng.pdf.multi">study </a> to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on museums and cultural institutions (UNESCO, 2020).</p>

<p>In this study, Unesco appraised museums’ initiatives around the world. Some of the digital activities developed during museum closures were:</p>
<ol>
<li>The use of previously digitised resources </li>
<li>Digitisation of planned activities during the months of lockdown</li>
<li>Increased activity on social media</li>
<li>Special activities created for lockdown</li>
<li>Professional  and  scientific  activities  organised  in  the  context  of  lockdown</li>
    </ol>

<p>Families and especially young people benefited the most from the situation, as they represent the part of the population that is most active online, interacting through an average number of 4-5 digital platforms (such as Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram) on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>We will now have a quick look at practices and actions organized remotely by cultural organizations (GLAMs) aiming to ensure interactive and creative activities for everyone during the pandemic.</p>

<p>In this context, Europeana, a distinguished institution that empowers the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation, showcased  a variety of cultural initiatives during the pandemic. All of them were carried out through digital media channels and especially, social media in order to facilitate access to the institutions’  cultural content and forge youth engagement in their activities.</p>

<p>Museums have primarily based their actions on their existing resources, like online collection portals and social media accounts and focused on creating new content, such as virtual exhibitions and virtual tours of their galleries via streaming platforms or realising digital educational material for children and adults.</p>
