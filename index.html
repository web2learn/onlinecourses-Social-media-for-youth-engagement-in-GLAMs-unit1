Undoubtedly, they have revolutionised the way people live and perceive their everyday life.

        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by
        default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to
        style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the
        showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS
        or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any
        HTML can go within the <strong>.accordion-body</strong>, though the transition
        does limit overflow.
